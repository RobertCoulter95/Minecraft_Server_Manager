# Minecraft_Server_Manager
This is a java program for managing a single or multiple minecraft servers.
Features a GUI for navigating multiple servers, and also the ability to change the settings of each server.
Currently what is working is selecting a server to show its properties, and you can start and stop a server.

Saving properties is bugged and it is what I am currently working on. 
Currently bugged is saving properties.
1. Properties will completely erase if the program itself is closed after clicking on as server to view its properties.
2. Properties only are saved it you first choose a server, change its properties, click save at the bottom, and then close the program.


To add servers to the program:
1. Navigate to the "MinecraftServer" folder. In this folder place the "server.jar" file which can be obtained from minecraft.net
https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/ 
You have to start the server and change the EULA file property from false to true.
